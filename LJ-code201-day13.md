<h1>Learning Journal 201 day 13</h1>
This week has been pretty intense. I really enjoyed the chart.js portion of the Bus Mall Project. I thought learning about local storage was pretty cool too. I am looking forward to learning more about that and how to implement it efficiently.
  I bombed both my quizzes this week so that sucks. Hopefully I pass the final.
I am not really that comfortable with JS or at least not as comfortable with it as I feel I should be for the amount I have put into it. Hopefully 301 doesn't have all the lame self help videos those are painful to watch.
