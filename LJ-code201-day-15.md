<h1>Learning Journal 201 day 15</h1>
We did a ton this week. I learned a lot about the functionality aspect of coding. The bus mall project was a great challenge and I enjoyed learning about local storage. I am looking forward to completing our project. I am interested to see how well I can implement what I learned in class into the project.
