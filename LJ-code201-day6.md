<h1>Learning Journal 201 day 6</h1>
Well today was an pretty crazy day trying to figure out how to sole the salmon cookie lab. I learned quite a bit just about how to take a problem and break down into separate pieces in order to solve it. I really enjoy using DOM to set up my html. I am still a little iffy on how it all works but the more I do it the better I will get. I am going to review tonight on constructor functions so that hopefully tomorrow will go a little smoother than today. I did read all the information pertaining to todays project but I not only read those article and chapters but a lot more in the css book as well so I don not think it sank in as much as it could've if I just focused on the specific readings for today.
