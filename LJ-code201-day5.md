<h1>Learning Journal 201 day 4-5</h1>
<p> Day four was a relatively easy day. It was fun getting to work with someone else and see someone else's style of writing code. I also enjoyed learning about more git commands and processes. Day 5 was even better I felt because we actually had a lot of tricky code to figure out with our partner as well as new git hub and git terminal command and process to work through. Setting up the functions to pass the test code on day 5 proved to be more challenging then both my partner and I expected. But we powered through it and got it done. I learned a lot in the process so to me that makes a successful day and successful days make me happy.
